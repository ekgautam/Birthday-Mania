# Birthday-Mania
A full fledged app which can be used to celebrate your birthday by sending a mail to an organisation including your basic details.Also it include online payment facility to their account.
Few teps before you get going :-
1. Get your google maps api key and insert in google_maps_api.xml .
2. In config.java file put in email id and password from which you have to send the email.
3. In MainActivity.java file enter EMAIL="" id where you have to send the mail.
4. I have used instamojo for payments so you need to get credentials for the same and fill in the map provided in Main Activity. It's free of cost so don't worry ;-).

Here are the few screenshots for your help
